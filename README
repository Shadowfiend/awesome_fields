= Awesome Fields
Awesome fields is a plugin that adds an extension to the built-in Rails
FormBuilder in the form of a new method, <tt>FormBuilder#field</tt>. This method
magically determines what type of field to display for the corresponding method.
So let's say you had a model MyModel with a migration that looked oddly like:
 create_table(:my_model) do |t|
   t.column 'magic', :string
   t.column 'number', :integer
   t.column 'hyperdate', :date
   t.column 'supertime', :time
   t.column 'incredidatetime', :datetime
 end

Then let's say we did this bit of magic:
 <% form_for :model, @model, :action => 'superplace' do |f| %>
   <%= f.field :magic %>
   <%= f.field :number %>
   <%= f.field :hyperdate %>
   <%= f.field :supertime %>
   <%= f.field :incredidatetime %>
 <% end %>
In this situation, you would get two plain text boxes, one date selector, one
time selector, and one datetime selector.

What if the `magic' field was really long (i.e., we generated a column with type
:text instead of :string)? Then we'd probably prefer a textarea. In this
situation, we pass the <tt>:long</tt> option to the +field+ method:
   <%= f.field :magic, :long => true %>
Different field types may deal with this option differently, and some may ignore
it entirely.

== Field Generation
There are two steps to generating the field: first, we determine what type of
field to generate, then we generate the actual HTML for it.

There are two ways we use to find the type of field to generate. First, we run
the method itself and look for what the class of the object returned is. If we
get a nil result from the method, then we use the actual database type as our
determiner.

To generate the actual HTML, we call a helper method. For example, if we had a
string field, then we would call +string_field+. Since there are already methods
for most fields, we simply alias the existing methods to the relevant ones.
Sometimes, the mapping isn't one-to-one. For example, in the case of strings,
sometimes we'll need to make the field a text area and other times just a simple
text field (see the situation where we're using the <tt>:long</tt> option
above). In these cases, we can implement the actual method and have it dispatch
to the relevant helper methods.

What if you want to specialize the behavior in one of your builders? Just
override the relevant methods! Then there's the other situation -- one where
maybe you've serialized an object to the database in YAML form, and you want to
display a field for it. Since the returned value from the method will be of your
class, we may be unable to resolve that class to an actual field type. In this
case, you can either alias in your own helper or implement the relevant method
in your own builder. The pattern of the methods called is simply the class name
underscored (literally, the result of
<tt>@object.send(method).class.underscore</tt>) followed by +_field+. So Strings
go to +string_field+, Dates to +date_field+, and DateTimes to +date_time_field+.

== Collection Fields
Basic fields are all well and good, but it'd be nice to be able to automatically
generate select boxes based on collection fields, too, and have them behave as
expected. Magic fields makes this easier to a certain extent, as well. First of
all, if a field returns a value that responds to the +collect+ method, then
the field is assumed to be a collection field (an exception is made for Strings,
which do respond to +collect+, but are handled as regular text fields).

Then, we use +collection_select+ to generate the appropriate field (actually, we
use +select+, because +collection_select+ doesn't allow us to easily indicate
the multiple objects that should be preselected). By default, the +value_method+
used to determine the value for the collection options is +id+. If a
+text_method+ is not specified, then the +name+ or +to_s+ methods are used (they
are attempted in that order).

For +select+, we also need an original collection -- basically, a list of all of
the possible values -- to use with the list of selected values.  If the objects
inside the collection are AR objects, then we take their class and issue a
<tt>find(:all)</tt> on it. For example, with this call:

 f.field :collection_method

If +collection_method+ returned a list of Post objects, then we issue a
<tt>Post::find(:all)</tt> to determine the full collection (of selected and
unselected values). This guessing can be overridden by providing a collection to
use instead by passing the <tt>:collection</tt> option with the relevant
collection.

You can override both the method used for display text and that used for the
option value by passing the +text_method+ and +value_method+ options to the
+field+ helper. Further options and HTML options are passed on to
+select+, as usual.

=== What About Collections of Non-ActiveRecord Objects?
Unfortunately, this convenience comes at a slight price when it comes to
collections of non-AR objects. If you want to use +field+ with its collection
field magic and you've got, say, integers in the collection, then you'll have to
do a bit of extra work and specify both the value and text methods, like so:

 f.field :numbers, :value_method => :to_int, :text_method => :to_int

In this case, since we're getting numbers out, we just use the +to_int+ method
for both the value and the text.

=== Notes
Since Rails will typecast date and datetime fields to the Ruby +Time+ class,
these typically won't be recognized appropriately. Currently, the +time_field+
method is implemented to double-check with the database the type that needs to
be used.  If you implement accessors for the relevant fields to return objects
of the appropriate type (see http://www.railsweenie.com/forums/1/topics/936 for
an example of how you could do this), then the appropriate methods will be
called without the extra level of indirection. Sadly, this specialization means
that any Time fields will always have their type checked twice.

Also, the presence of <tt>FormBuilder#field</tt> does NOT in any way mean the
other helpers are not available for use. If the decisions +field+ makes don't
float your boat, feel free to put in a direct call to the regular helpers. The
purpose of +field+ is to try and reduce the repetition (it's a already a string,
why say it again?), not to get in your way. If it's getting in your way, you
probably need a different solution.
